# ThreePhaseSystemCalculator<br>
A calculator for three-phase systems finding all currents and voltage (Phase)<br><br>
You choose the circuit configuration (e.g. Delta-Star) and you fill in the required information<br><br>
Pressing 'Calculate' shows the results (Phase Voltage, Phase Current, Line Current, and Power)<br><br>
TKinter used for the GUI and cmath and math libraries used for the calculation of formulas
