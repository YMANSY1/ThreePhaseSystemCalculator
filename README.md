# ThreePhaseSystemCalculator
A calculator for three-phase systems finding all currents and voltage (Phase)
You choose the circuit configuration (e.g. Delta-Star) and you fill in the required information
Pressing 'Calculate' shows the results (Phase Voltage, Phase Current, Line Current, and Power)
TKinter used for the GUI and cmath and math libraries used for the calculation of formulas
